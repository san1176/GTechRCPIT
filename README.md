# GTechRCPIT

GTechRCPIT is a mobile application developed to educate college students about Google's suite of services and technologies. This app is being developed by students of RCPIT as part of a tech initiative to promote digital literacy and skills among peers.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The aim of GTechRCPIT is to:
- Teach students how to effectively use various **Google technologies**.
- Provide hands-on tutorials and walkthroughs for tools like Google Drive, Docs, Gmail, Google Cloud, and more.
